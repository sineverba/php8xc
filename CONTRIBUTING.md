# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**. This page details how to 
contribute and the expected code quality for all contributions.

## Pull Requests

We accept contributions via Pull Requests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

   - Create a branch `feature-myawesomefeature` or `hotfix-myhotfix` from `develop`
   - Push your branch against `develop` branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.


**Happy coding**!
